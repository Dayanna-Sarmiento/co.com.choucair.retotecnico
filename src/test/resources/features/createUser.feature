  Scenario: Login to the user creation space
    Given access to user creation must be facilitated
      | firstName | lastName | email | birthMonth | birthDay | birthYear |
      | firstName | lastName | email | birthMonth | birthDay | birthYear |
    When you enter to fill out the requested fields
      | city | zip |
      | city | zip |
